## Resampling Techniques  

* Random Under-Sampling  
* Random Over-Sampling  
* Cluster-Based Over Sampling  
* Informed Over Sampling:
    * SMOTE    
    * MSOTE  

## Algorithmic Ensemble Techniques  

* Bagging-Based  

* Boosting-Based  
* Adaptive Boosting-Ada Boost  
* Gradient Tree Boosting  
* XG Boost
